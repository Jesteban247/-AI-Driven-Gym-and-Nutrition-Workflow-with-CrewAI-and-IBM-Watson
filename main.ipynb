        "\n",
        "1. **Current Parameters**:\n",
        "   - **Decoding Method**: Using `greedy` decoding ensures straightforward and predictable responses, but it may lack creativity and diversity. For more varied outputs, exploring methods like beam search or sampling could be beneficial.\n",
        "   - **Max New Tokens**: The current limit of 500 tokens per response is practical for managing costs and ensuring quick responses. However, this can lead to incomplete answers, especially for detailed tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Usage and Token Management**:\n",
        "   - Given the extensive research and writing tasks handled by four agents, the total token usage has reached 20,556 tokens. This is substantial but manageable within the constraints of a free trial.\n",
        "   - With a free trial limit of 50,000 tokens, it is crucial to balance the length of responses with the total number of tokens used.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Improving Results**:\n",
        "   - **Increasing Token Limit**: If additional tokens are available or if you upgrade your plan, increasing the `max_new_tokens` limit could enhance response completeness. Testing with a limit of 2,000 tokens might provide more detailed answers.\n",
        "   - **Prompt Optimization**: Refining prompts to be more specific can help manage token usage efficiently and improve the quality of responses.\n",
        "   - **Exploring Decoding Methods**: Experimenting with alternative decoding methods could yield more diverse and insightful outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Conclusion**\n",
        "\n",
        "The current setup with a token limit of 500 is effective for controlling costs and generating concise responses. However, for more comprehensive results, especially in complex research and writing tasks, increasing the token limit would be advantageous. For now, managing token usage carefully while optimizing prompts and exploring decoding methods can help maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of the AI agents."

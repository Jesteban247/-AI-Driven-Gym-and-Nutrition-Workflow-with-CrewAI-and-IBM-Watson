The best diets and foods for bulking and cutting based on scientific evidence are:

**Bulking Diet:**

* Include foods high in protein (1.3-1.8g per kg of bodyweight) and low in saturated fat
* Focus on eating nutrient-dense foods, and only increase calories gradually
* Avoid processed, high fat, and high sugar foods
* Include foods such as lean proteins, whole grains, and vegetables

**Cutting Diet:**

* A calorie-deficit diet with a focus on nutrient-dense, lower-calorie foods to promote weight loss
* Prioritize lean proteins, nutrient-dense vegetables, and whole grains
* Focus on eating nutrient-dense foods, and only decrease calories gradually
* Avoid processed, high fat, and high sugar foods
* Include foods such as lean proteins, whole grains, and vegetables
